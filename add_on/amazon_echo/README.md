## Quick Start

1. Execute the installer using - 'sh install_echo.sh' 
2. Tell Echo, "discover my devices"
3. Use Echo's "zone name on" and "zone name off" to set the BOOST on or off as required

Note: if the hot water zone name contains the words 'hot water' then Echo will respond to 'hot water' e.g for a zone name of 'Ch. Hot Water' Echo will respond to 'hot water' on/off
